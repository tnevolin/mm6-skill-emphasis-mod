# version 74

* Reprogrammed monster damage computations. Experimental. Needs testing.
	* Attack1 stays as is.
	* Attack2 used Attack1 base damage. Fixed this to properly use Attack2 base damage instead.
	* Spell damage had completely inexplicable computation. Fixed it to use proper spell damage computation as in description.
		* Excluding Mass Distortion - it uses victim HP for damage computation. Hopefully, monsters don't use it.
		* Excluding Finger of Death - it uses victim HP for damage computation.

# version 73

* Fixed shield displaed recovery penalties not being reduced with mastery.

# version 72

* Fixed bug when second plate wearer didn't cover.

# version 71

* Fixed Altar of Electricity.

# version 70

* Added handler for ranged weapon damage calculation by skill.

# version 69

* Fixed bug with dual wielding use.

# version 68

* Sword speed bonus: 0-4-4.
* Axe speed bonus: 0-2-2.
* Sword damage bonus: 0-0-1.
* Bow damage bonus: 0-1-1.
* Archer bow damage bonus: 1-1-1.
* Dual wield uses full skill level instead of dividing by sqrt(2).
* Melee weapon group is split to two groups: {sword, dagger} and others.

# version 67

* Fixed Shrapmetal. It does not autoaim anymore as it should. 

# version 66

* Fixed shield reducing projectile damage.

# version 65

* Fixed occasional crash when checking monster stats.

# version 64

* Guardian Angel spell modification.
	* Spell lowers death HP threshold by 10 per skill point for all characters.
	* Spell duration is 1 hours + 5 minutes times skill level.
	* Spell description is updated accordingly.

# version 63

* Added ranged attack of different kind to some lesser outdoor monsters. The attack type is either weaker version of what advanced kind already has (Goblin King, Mystic of Baa) or something lore wise (Catpurse throws knifes, Skeleton shoots arrows). That reduces the slaughter shooting over the river tactics as well as increase value of shield spell (more arrow shooting monsters).

Highly experimental feature as I manually modified monsters statistics. Please report any irregularities.

# version 62

* Added blaster entries everywhere bow goes. I completely forgot blaster is a weapon. :(
* Slight modification to spear type base damages to keep their 1H (spear < trident < halberd) and 2H (spear > trident > halberd) values. Nothing too drastic, though. Evened out their bonuses too.
  * Spear: 1d11
  * Trident: 2d6
  * Halberd: 4d3
* Also fixed parameters not being changed for some spear type items.
* Archer does not give more damage to ranged weapons (bow, blaster) with skill. Instead they double attack and recovery bonuses for them.
* Slightly increased initial recovery bonus for dagger and blaster to bring them closer to their vanilla values. Their recovery does not progress with skill anyway.
* Corrected blaster attack. Previous calculations didn't account for vanilla skill rank attack multiplier.

# version 61

* Two handed weapon does not double own damage. Each weapon stats are now modified accordingly instead. It is cleaner this way.
	* Max bonus for two-handed swords and axes is increased to match dual wielding option.
	* Base damage for all spears, tridents, halberds is modified to even them out a little. Spear is slightly stronger two-handed and halberd is slightly stronger one-handed with trident in between.
	* Some weapon bonuses are spread more evenly according to their price.
* Two-handed weapon damage increment by skill is increased to 3 to match improved general weapon stat progression.

# version 60

* Reverted sword and axe base recovery to vanilla values. I didn't see much use making axe exceptionally bad and unusable in early game. Each weapon should have its merits.

# version 59

* Reverted spear attack bonus to 2x of normal. I have analyzed it and it really doesn't add much on average but may be slightly useful against heavily armored monster that party encounter early. Like gold dragon in the temple of the snake.
* Set damage progression to 2-3-4, recovery progression to 4-5-6. This should not be too much against doubled monster health. Anything below that was too indistinguishable from vanilla progression.
* Restored double weapon damage for two-handed sword, spear, and axe. They need to match damage of their dual versions. That makes two-handed spear quite a strong early game weapon but this benefit wear down quickly with skill advancement.
* Dagger is redesigned as crowd fighting weapon giving it extra damage per each enemy in melee range per level of skill. It overtakes best combos with 10+ enemies in close combat.

# version 58

* Double own damage is applied to two handed swords only and not to other two handed weapons. Otherwise, two handed spear becomes an extremely powerful in early game.
* All combat classes get spear and leather as initial skills. It seems to be a most powerful and fast combination in early game. If so then why seeking anything else?
* Added damage rate for current player against given monster in monster info. That shows more precise damage rate than the one in player screen against generic 100 AC monster.
* Disabled monster anti-sub zigzagging and let them go straight to the party to catch up quicker. This maneuver is no good against homing missiles anymore.
* Monster engagement area is increased. Now more monsters jump at you when you disturb at least one.

# version 57

* Modified classes starting skills. Gave them mostly their preferable weapon and best armor. Removed magic from starting skills to allow better magic distribution across party. Archer is no longer bound to stuck with air magic. Also archer no longer has bow skill by default but it can be chosen. I guess one shooter doesn't really save the party in early game.
* Fixed bug with magic attack.

# version 56

* Monster damage is doubled. I think it still should be fair enough with additional buffs but let me know if it is too much.

# version 55

## Shrine behavior changed

Shrines provide one blessing per calendar year and these blessing are accumulated and never lost and can be claimed any time regardless of month. Seer still tells you which shrine to visit but this has no effect.

For example, if player never visited shrine of might first year and then visited it second year they are entitled for two blessings for two passed years right away (i.e. +10 and +3 might). This way blessings opportunity is never lost even when player unable to reach the shrine in its corresponding month.

This feature makes this version incompatible with older saves due to newly introduced counter variables.

I have pretty limitedly tested it on few shrines and few months. It seems to work properly but bugs still may be lurking around. Let me know if you see any inconsistencies or installation problems.

# version 54

* Spear attack bonus grows tuned down a little on higher ranks. It is now: 4-5-6 and the same is reflected in spear skill description.
* Spear does not grant AC bonus anymore and it is also reflected in description.
* Monster HP is doubled to match the corresponding early dagger and 2h weapons damage increase. Even with this buff I believe they are still easy to beat but let's adjust slowly.

# version 53

* Dagger does not have modified tripled damage chance. Nor that was ever implemented.
* Instead dagger damage bonus is tripled. That makes it very desirable early game weapon.
* Spear attack grows twice as fast with skill. That emulates spear to be long reach armor piercing weapon improving hit chance against heavy armored targets.

# version 52

* Displayed more info on monster information dialog.
* Magic immunity threshold lifted to 1000. Now all immunities are just 200 resistances.

# version 51

# version 47

* All learned melee weapon, ranged weapon, and armor skills are advanced at the same level when any one is advanced withing a group. This unlocks melee/ranged weapon and armor switching along the game without losing past skill point investments.
* Dual weapon skill levels are adjusted to simulate two weapons skill point investment split. They are divided by sqrt(2) for the purpose of skill contribution if different weapon types.

# version 46

* Reduced Factor and Banker cost 5 times. They are now more useful and pay for themselves after ~1k gold found, not after ~10k as in vanilla.
* Added more NPC shortcuts.

# version 45

Further tune up of might vs. magic balance.

* Reverted attribute effects back to vanilla. Linear scale requires more attribute balance thinking which I despise. Better leave it as it was.
* [Slightly decreased weapon speed and damage bonuses](https://github.com/tnevolin/mm6-skill-emphasis-mod#bonus-increment-per-level-based-on-rank).

* Recovery bonus by mastery: 6, 7, 8.
* Axe recovery bonus is -20.
* Sword recovery bonus is -10.

# version 32

* Disabled primary stat fountains raising primary stats by 2 if below 15. They are real temptation to visit them **before** visiting altars. The strategy requiring quick maps traversal in front of yet strong monsters. That breaks the steady development and exploration plan.
